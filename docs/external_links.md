## Non-commercial
I provide links to external articles, books, HOWTOs, courses etc for people to learn more about Linux, Ubuntu, Debian, asterisk, git, github etc.
I provide links ot providers of services such as SIP trunking, call termination, asterisk as a service etc.

Where such links are to web sites are for commercial services: 
- I have no commercial affiliation whatsoever these web sites or the companies that run them
- I receive no commission, fees, or other fungible benefits from any of these web sites or the companies that run them

I will gladly accept links to similar Internet resources provided the following conditions are met:
* The links should be submitted as a pull request on this github repository
* The Links should not contain any tracking components in the URLs
* The links should not include any sales affiliation components that allows anyone to derive sales commissions, fees or other recognitions
* The pull request should clearly state the above

If a link is subsequently found to violate the above conditions, **I reserve the right to edit the URL and / or remove the links completely**.

I am not at all against commercial affiliations / sales commissions / fees or other types of recognitions. This repository is just not the place for them.

## Request for removal
If you are the owner of one of the sites listed, and you do not want a particular URL listed, open an issue indicating:
* Which specific URL you want removed
* Reason for removal
* Proof that you own the URL

I will be happy to remove URLs for any issues opened with valid information as indicated above.

## No recommendations
I do not specifically recommend any of the products or services or sites listed. 
I also do not specifically express any preferences of one link, service or product over another, except when I explicitly include my opinion from my own personal experience, annotated as such.

## No preference for retail web sites
In general I do not have a preference for any particular retail web site over another.
If the same product is listed on multiple web sites, I would **prefer** links to a web site 
that have a history of keeping links available even when the product in question is no
longer being sold by them. Amazon is **one example** of such a retail web site.
This does not mean I **prefer** Amazon links or accept only Amazon links
